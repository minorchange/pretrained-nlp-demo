# pre-trained-nlp-demo

Pre trained nlp models do generalize surprisingly well. For some use cases no training/fine tuning is needed at all.
This repo is a collection of some nlp tasks to get a feeling of what is possible out of the box.
If possible, models that can cope with the german language are chosen.
